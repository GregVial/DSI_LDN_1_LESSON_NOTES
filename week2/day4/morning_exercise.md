Load the office supplies dataset (office_supples.csv), which we looked at last week.
Using group by answer the following questions
- What were the total number of sales per region? Units sold? Total value?
- What was the breakdown for each region by rep?
- What were the sales by date?
- What were the mean sales per region and broken down by rep? Mean for each month?

Obtain the Sleep alone dataset (sleeping-alone-data.csv), which contains a survey about couples who sleep alone.

You can also load it directly using the following link:
 https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/sleeping-alone-data/sleeping-alone-data.csv


In Jupyter complete the following tasks, using group by where applicable:

1. Load the data set and consider cleaning steps
2. Look at the sleep alone question:
- How many response types are there?
- What is the distribution of responses by categories eg gender?
3. Look at the age, income of the respondents:
- How many response types are there?
- What is the distribution of responses?
4. Can you estimate the age, income of every person in the dataset?
- Make whatever assumption you need to get this done easily
- What is the mean age for people who "Never" slept alone and people who sleep alone "Every night"?
5. Look for difference in the Age distribution by looking at all "Sleep Alone?" responses.
- Plot the data
6. Using group by look for differences in:
- Gender
- Age
- Household Income
- Education

    "As a programming exercise let's make an Artificial Intelligence that can play noughts and crosses. Noughts and crosses is the game where you have a 3x3 board and you place either an X or a O to mark your move. You win by placing three of your marker in a row before your opponent achieves the same. You cannot play your move on top of the opponent's marker.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a starting point, I suggest just writing a program where the computer selects a position to play at random (so not particularly intelligent). If you get that far you can think about how to make an algorithm such that the computer appears to have intelligence when playing. Of course, the aim with machine learning is to arrive at a way that an AI would not need to be explicitly programmed - but it's still interesting to think about how that explicit programming can be done, if only to avoid it!\n",
    "\n",
    "We will do this as a pair exercise, and due to the complexity we will say that you can import modules to make things easier. It should also be possible to do it without."

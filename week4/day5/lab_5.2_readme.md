## Introduction

Drawing from best practices covered in our lesson (5.1), use Tableau to generate a visualization of your weekly project and share results with the class.

#### Requirements

- Create clear communication and approachable visual representations
- Communicate  main insights from your data using classification
- Use graphical displays
- Proactively highlight strengths and weaknesses of your data, model, predictions, and recommendations

#### Guidelines

- Use labels, titles, and legends for your plots
- Provide context around your project with a clear problem statement, modeling strategy, and hypothesis
- List your model and data assumptions, strengths, and weaknesses


In Tableau, build a histogram and at least one other visualization on your scraped USAJobs.com data.

> ***Hint:*** To bin continuous variables in Tableau, go to Data > Create > Bins

Remember to ask:

- Who: Who is my target audience for this visual?
- What: What do they already know about this project? What do they need to know?
- How: How does my project affect this audience? How might they interpret (or misinterpret) the data?

#### Deliverable

- Visualize different aspects of your data and machine learning model (accuracy plots, feature correlations, etc.)
- Quickly share your visualizations, focusing on actionable information (2-3 mins)
- Highlight key facts that relate to the your project data

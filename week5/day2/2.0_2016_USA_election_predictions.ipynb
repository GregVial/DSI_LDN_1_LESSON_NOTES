    "First, we need an overview of how the system works. Each state has a weighting which is based to some extent on its population size, this is called the Electoral College. There are 538 Electoral College votes in total, and whomever wins the popular vote in a state gets all the Electoral College votes for that state - with two exceptions, Maine and Nebraska. These two states have a Congressional District system that means that the winner of each Congressional District (2 for Maine and 3 for Nebraska) gets 1 vote for each and then 2 extra votes for whomever won the state overall (so 4 total Electoral College votes for Maine and 5 for Nebraska). Additionally Washington DC has 3 Electoral College votes though it is not a state. \n",
    "\n",
    "It takes 270 votes to win, and if any candidate fails to reach this then there would have to be a House of Representatives vote to decide with each state having one vote (this has happened three times: in 1800, 1824, and 1876). As you no doubt remember, this system means it is also possible to win having lost the nationwide popular vote as George W Bush did in 2000. We will hence go for a state by state model and not consider the nationwide popularity of each candidate."

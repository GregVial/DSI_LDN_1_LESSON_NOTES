Data Science Immersive | Capstone Project 4				

Your project will be assessed using the following standards, [derived from the data science workflow](../../../../resources/syllabus/DSI-workflow-v1.pdf):

- [ ] Identify Problem
- [ ] Acquire Data
- [ ] Parse Data
- [ ] Mine Data
- [ ]	Refine Data
- [ ] Model Data
- [ ] Present Data
- [ ] *Bonus* Deploy Data

Acceptable performance for these standards is based on how well you've performed the specific requirements listed below.

### Performance Evaluation
> Instructors: Mark boxes with 'X' or "n/a" if a section does not apply. Note that "Exceeds Expectations" (3pts) is really only applicable for student writeups or specially marked "*Bonus*" Options.

| Requirements | Incomplete (0) | Does Not Meet Expectations (1) | Meets Expectations (2) | Exceeds Expectations (3) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Identify: Create executive summary | | | | |
| Acquire: Demonstrate how you imported, queried, and sorted your data | | | | n/a |
| Parse: Identify any outliers, define variables | | | | n/a |
| Mine: Perform statistical analysis, correlate data | | | | n/a |
| Refine: Describe and plot your data  | | | | n/a |
| Model: Perform model (train subset as needed)| | | | n/a |
| Model: Tune and evaluate model | | | | n/a |
| Present: Discuss data pipeline - importing/sorting/querying/munging | | | | |
| Present: Discuss statistical and visual analysis | | | | |
| Present: Discuss model selection and implementation process | | | | *Bonus: Describe any source code used*  |
| Present: Interpret findings and relate to goals/criteria | | | | |
| Present: Create recommendations for stakeholders & summarize next steps | | | | |
| *Bonus! Deploy: Address how to (re)train model over time* | | | | |
| *Bonus! Deploy: Discuss how to deploy model in production environment* | | | | |
| *Bonus! Present: Create blog post summary* | | | | |

## Introduction

In groups, we are going to generate an analysis over two distinct but related datasets. Then we will present to the class.

#### Requirements

- Search the web for two datasets that are related (ex: two dataset about crime statistics, a dataset about the sales of a company and another one about industry wide metric, two datasets with economic metrics about countries). The datasets shouldn't have the same data (some overlap is ok), but different data about the same subject.

- Create all your analysis in a jupyter notebook. 
- Load data sets.
- Perform EDA, with comments on the context of the data (ex: econometrical data of sub-saharan countries), comments on data quality and the dimensions of the data.
- Create some pivot tables summarizing and aggregating important aspects of the data. You can also try to join or append the data of both datasets.
- Throughout the analysis, plot relevant variables and relations between data (Bonus for graphs made in Tableau and embedded in the notebook). 
- Plan a 15min presentation with the results of your group analysis.

## Objectives

- Practice pandas reading in data and selecting columns
- Practice plotting techniques

## Introduction

You are a data scientist at a property investment firm and are tasked with
identifying good housing properties for future investment. The first step in
this process is understanding what characteristics are associated with
housing values. In other words, you need to build a model that predicts, from
available data, the value of a housing property.

## Exercise

#### Requirements

The starter code contains a few exercises:

- After walking through an example plots, students are asked to make several more.
- Students should then discuss any plots that reveal interesting relationships between the variables. This and the previous exercise can be done in small groups.
- Advanced students can explore using Seaborn to make plots more efficiently

**Bonus:**
- Put in the effort to make the plots look better. For example, including units by reading the data set description page.
- Plot the two best variables on the same plot with different colors for the points.


#### Starter code

Using the [starter code](./code/starter-code/W3-Lab-1.2-Starter.ipynb)
* Download the dataset
* Load the data into pandas
* Follow the instructions to generate plots of variables that may be usefully related

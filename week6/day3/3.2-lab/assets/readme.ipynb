    "In this lab we will practice using Random Forest Regressor and Boosted Trees Regressor on the [Project 6 Data](../../03-projects/01-projects-weekly/project-06/assets/data). In the [asset folder](../../assets/datasets/imdb_p6_sample.csv), there's a sample of the data you will have gathered as part of Project 6. You're invited to perform your analysis on the complete dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be training several regression models to predict the movie rating based on few text features that were extracted as part of Project 6. In particular we'll look at the presence of words like: (excellent, great, love, beautiful, best, hope, groundbreaking, amazing...) in the reviews and use them to predict the movie rating.\n",

    "- this walks the students through a sample dataset, they should actually do it on the full dataset they have created as part of Project 6.\n",
    "- the code for this lab is shorter than usual in order to give the students time to practice with Tableau."

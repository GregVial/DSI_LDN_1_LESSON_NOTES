Week 8 | Exercise 2.0

> This should be a pair exercise

Let's expand what you can do using Python from your Terminal. Note some commands:

## Command 1: `cat`

`cat` is a linux prompt that prints out the contents of a file. Try calling `cat` on input.txt from your command line.

## Command 2: Redirection `>` and Pipe `|`

You can take text from your command line and write it to a new file using ```>```. Try writing this from any folder:

```bash
$ ls > list_of_files.txt
$ cat list_of_files.txt
```

You can also use the ```|``` operator to pipe text into a file to use as input.

## Command 3: `sys.stdin`

`stdin` is the standard input call. If you call it within your program you can use the pipe'd input in your code. (This means you don't need to open and read a file, or use the `raw_input()` command).

You can access it in Python by importing the `sys` library:

```python
import sys
for line in sys.stdin:
  #do something
```

## Command 4: `curl`
`curl` takes data from a URL and feeds it into the interpreter. Try typing this:

```bash
$curl http://textfiles.com/stories/elveshoe.txt
```


### Step 1
Given a text file `input.txt`, write a program `counter.py` that will give you the count of unique words in that file.

Your output should print each word and its count on a new line separated by a tab, like this:

```bash
cha 2
i  1
like  1
to  1
```

You should be able to run your program from the command line by calling:

```bash
cat input.txt | ./counter.py
```

### Step 2
Write your word counts to a file called output_1.txt



### Step 3: Files calling files

Create a file `temperature.py`. Write two functions in that file: `def celsius_to_farenheit(x):` and `def farenheit_to_celcius(x)` that convert between units. Save and close the file.

Run `python` from the command line. You can now import that file (like you do for every Python package). Run your programs by calling them from `temperature`:

```python
>>> import temperature
>>> print temperature.farenheit_to_celcius(95)
35
```

### Step 4: curling
Go back to your `counter.py` file to generate word counts on a remote file by calling:

```bash
$curl http://textfiles.com/stories/elveshoe.txt | ./counter.py > output_2.txt
```

**Now, rewrite your workflow so you clean the text (encode, remove punctuation, convert to lowercase) in a function defined in a new file.**

For example, create a file `my_cleaner.py` that contains the function `def clean_text(x)`

When you're done, your `counter.py` file should look something like this:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python

import sys
import my_cleaner

for line in sys.stdin:
  line = my_cleaner.clean_text(line)
  #do something
```

### Challenge
Pick one of the longer stories from [textfiles.com/stories/](http://textfiles.com/stories/). Create a plot of the most commonly used words. Don't open a Jupyter notebook for this.

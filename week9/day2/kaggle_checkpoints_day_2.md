## Day 2 Requirements:

By the end of the day, your group should have the following completed:

1. Starter code to load your data into a pandas dataframe. This code should be pushed to your team's github and optionally submitted to the Kaggle Leaderboard (as submission practice).
- Initial code with comments to organise and clean the data, also hosted on github.
- In your own words, a problem statement which you will be modelling against. This can be similar to the project description on Kaggle. Be sure to discuss this sufficiently with your team. The problem statement should be clearly written down and placed in a readme.md file in your team's github repo.
- If the previous items are fulfilled, then initial EDA on the data related to your problem statement.

Modify your optionally created Trello board as needed.

Get in the habit of submitting pull requests for branches with assignments of team members to review the code. Then you can merge into the master after review by a second
person, which helps spread knowledge and avoid bugs.


**Problem Statement Reminder:**

1. Start up a new document and describe the following:
  * What is our problem statement?
  * What can we learn from the data in order to make an educated hypothesis?
  * What is our hypothesis?

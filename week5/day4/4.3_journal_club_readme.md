Week 5 | Lesson 4.0

### LEARNING OBJECTIVES
*After this lesson, you will be able to:*
- Walk through real world dataset case studies
- Map out the analytics/data science workflow used
- Discuss pros/cons of the methods involved

### STUDENT PRE-WORK
*Before this lesson, you should already be able to:*
- Perform EDA
- Perform classification
- Demonstrate proficiency with basic SQL syntax

## Opening (10 mins)
In this class we will review several case studies in order to demonstrate how messy real data can be.

**Check:** Can anyone explain what steps are involved in data cleaning and preparation?

> Answer:
Answers can include any of the following:
- filling missing data
- normalization
- scaling

**Check:** Can anyone explain what classification is and how it is performed? What methods have we learned so far?

> Answer:
- KNN
- Logistic Regression


Our first case is a study on the default of Credit Card Clients performed by Yeh et al. in 2009. The data can be found in the UCI dataset repository.

For this lesson you will be working in pairs. Take 20-30 minutes to first read over the paper.


**Check:** See if you can answer the following questions:

1. What is the goal of the study? (Hint: This can typically be found in the abstract.)
2. What is the target variable (hint: look at the website and dataset)
3. What models do they compare? (Hint: although you have not yet seen all of them, try to grasp the differences)
4. How do they judge the goodness of a model? Do they use accuracy? If not, what do they use?
5. What validation method do they use? Simple train/test split? Cross Validation?
6. Which model performs best (if relevant)?
7. How do they deal with missing data (if relevant)?
7. How could the paper be improved?

## Conclusion (5 mins)
We have reviewed few classification studies and explored some issues around data preparation, model building and model selection.

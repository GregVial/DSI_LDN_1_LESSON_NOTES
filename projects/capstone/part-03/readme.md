### Overview

Document your work and get feedback along the way! Write about your analysis as you tune the model for your capstone project and summarize your initial findings.

This "Progress Report" should describe your approach and results, while also documenting any successes, setbacks, and lessons learned along the way.

Include visual and statistical analysis in your progress report, so you can get in-depth feedback. Be prepared to meet 1:1 with your instructors to discuss your results so far.

**Goal**: A summative report that describes your progress and includes your initial analysis, results, and any roadblocks or surprises.

### Requirements

Your work must:

- Create a "Progress Report" that documents your performance so far:
 - Summarize and refine exploratory data analysis, correlating and plotting data
 - Run model (Train and test subset as needed)
 - Summarize initial results and describe how you intend to evaluate & tune
 - Describe successes, setbacks, & lessons learned along the way.

- ***Bonus:***
 - Visualize your model using two or more of the data-viz tools we've covered in class 
 - Create a blog post of at least 500 words explaining your model, process, and lessons learned for a non-technical audience. Include 1-2 graphics to illustrate your approach. Link to it in your Progress Report notebook.

---

### Necessary Deliverables / Submission

- Materials must be submitted in a clearly labeled Jupyter notebook, including:
 - Markdown writeups, code, and visualizations
- Materials must be submitted via a Github PR to the instructor's repo.
- Materials should be submitted by the beggining of week 10; 1:1 meetings will occur during Week 10.

### Suggested Ways to Get Started

- Donâ€™t hesitate to write throwaway code to solve short term problems
- Read the docs for whatever technologies you use. Most of the time, there is a tutorial that you can follow, but not always, and learning to read documentation is crucial to your success!
- Write pseudocode before you write actual code. Thinking through the logic of something helps.  
- Document **everything**.

### Project Feedback + Evaluation

[Attached here is a complete rubric for this project.](./part-03-rubric.md)

Your instructors will score each of your technical requirements using the scale below:

    Score | Expectations
    ----- | ------------
    **0** | _Incomplete._
    **1** | _Does not meet expectations._
    **2** | _Meets expectations, good job!_
    **3** | _Exceeds expectations, you wonderful creature, you!_

 This will serve as a helpful overall gauge of whether you met the project goals, but __the more important scores are the individual ones__ above, which can help you identify where to focus your efforts for the next project!

### Overview

Your goal as a group is to demostrate proficiency with the use of supervised and unsupervised learning techniques. You will do this through the analysis of a dataset making use of your data munging and machine learning skills. After the analysis is complete you will make a group presentation to share your results.

### Requirements

Your work must:

- Choose a data set from https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data that you can use to pose a classification problem.
- Slack the Group name and dataset you will use.
- Describe your data.
- Perform methods of exploratory data analysis, including:
  - Use Matplotlib & Tableau to create visualizations
  - Use NumPy to apply basic summary statistics.
  - Use K-means and Hierarchical Clustering to get a better understanding of your data. What are the optimal number of clusters with those two methods? 
- Use one of the advanced classification models to fit the data (Ex: Logistic Regression, using a penalty functino, or Random Forest).
- Visually compare the clusters you got with the labelled data.
- (Bonus) You can also use PCA for reducing the dimensionality of your model.
- Fit a classification model using the cluster membership as labels. What performance measures do you get?
- Prepare a 10 min presentation with your results.

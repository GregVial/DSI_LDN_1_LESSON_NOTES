This tutorial will tell you how to launch an instance of ec2 and connect to it
using bash. You can also refer to the documentation:
http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EC2_GetStarted.html

1. You should go to the ec2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/
and choose to "Launch Instance". You should then select all the defaults (such
as that it is an Amazon Machine Image). When prompted you should let it select
a new key pair, and you will then be prompted to download this key file. You should
put this in a clearly marked folder so you can refer back to it later. It will
have a ".pem" extension. If you go to the instances page you can see the new instance
there, along with its Public DNS which you can use to refer to it.

To connect to your instance, open up a terminal window and navigate to the folder
containing the .pem key file. Type:
$ chmod 400 my_key_file_here.pem
$ ssh -i my_key_file_here.pem ec2-user@instance_public_DNS_here
you will get a prompt about security - say yes to go ahead
you are now in the terminal of the remote instance.

You only need to issue the chmod command once. To reconnect to your instance later
you just need to be in the folder containing your .pem file and type:
$ ssh -i my_key_file_here.pem ec2-user@instance_public_DNS_here
i.e. this is what you do every time you want to connect.

2. To move files from your local computer to an ec2 instance, or the other way around:
First set up your ec2 instance and ssh in. In another
terminal window go to the directory containing the ".pem" key file you use to ssh into
your ec2. For ease of use if you wish to transfer a file to ec2 you can place it
in this directory too (or not).

From local to ec2 home directory, write this in your local shell:
Note the :~ after the public DNS:

$ scp -i your_key_file_here.pem (optional full path/)file_you_want_to_move ec2-user@public_DNS_here:~

Note: paths in Linux are written with ~ for the home directory of the user eg.
~/Downloads
would be your downloads folder.

From ec2 to local, write this in your local shell:
$ scp -i your_key_file_here.pem ec2-user@public_DNS_here:~/path_to_file_on_ec2 ~/path_to_store_file_locally_including_filename_and_extension
